<h2><b>Welcome to the Dong Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Lab!</b> </h2>
<p><b>Accelerate Discovery with Computation &amp; Automation for a Healthy and Sustainable World</b></p>
<p>We develop and apply physics-based and data-driven computational methods to understand multiscale processes, from electronic structures to emergent properties. </p>
<p>We develop design strategies for molecules, materials, and processes that matter in renewable energy, biomedicine, and other areas of societal importance.</p>
